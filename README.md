DataWareHouse and Data Analysis
In this Project I have created a data ware house and adopted the best practices as per industry standards.
The project involves creating a DataWareHouse from CSV files from two different sources (ERP & CRM) and then creating a Medallion data architecture that divides the ETL process into Gold,Silver and Bronze layers with well defined seperation of concerns.
Each layer is developed to prepare the data imcrementally preparing the data ready for consumption.
Thereafter I have conducted detailed analysis of the data and created reports to generate insights.
